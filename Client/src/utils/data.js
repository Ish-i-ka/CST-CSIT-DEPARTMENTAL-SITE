        <p>We are proud to announce that a team of four students from our department has won the National Coding Championship 2025, beating over 200 teams from universities across the country.</p>
        
        <p>The winning team, "Code Wizards," consisted of Rahul Sharma (4th year), Priya Patel (3rd year), Amit Kumar (4th year), and Sneha Gupta (2nd year). They demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and teamwork throughout the competition.</p>
        
        <p>The championship, organized by TechCorp Inc., is one of the most prestigious coding competitions in the country. It tests participants' abilities to solve complex algorithmic problems under time constraints. The final round, held in Bangalore last weekend, featured 20 teams that had qualified through regional rounds.</p>
        
        <p>"It was an intense competition with some really challenging problems," said team leader Rahul Sharma. "We had been preparing for months, solving problems together every weekend. Our professors' guidance and the rigorous training in data structures and algorithms really paid off."</p>
        
        <p>The team won a cash prize of ₹5,00,000, internship opportunities at TechCorp, and the latest gaming laptops for each team member. More importantly, they have brought recognition to our department and university on the national stage.</p>
        
        <p>Department Head Dr. Rajesh Kumar expressed his pride in the team's achievement: "This victory reflects the quality of education and training we provide at our department. These students have not only made us proud but have also inspired their peers to excel in competitive programming."</p>
